Cruisin' on down Main Street
You're relaxed and feelin' good 
Next thing that you know you're seein'
Octopus in the neighborhood!
Surfin' on a sound wave 
Swingin' through the stars
Take a left at your intestine
Take your second right past Mars.
On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS
Navigate a nostril
Climb on THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS
Spank a plankton, too
On our Magic School Bus 
Raft a river of lava
On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS
Such a fine thing to do!
So strap your bones right to the seat
Come on in and don't be shy -
Just to make your day complete
You might get baked into a pie
On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS...
Step inside - it's a wilder ride!
Come on - ride on THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS!
